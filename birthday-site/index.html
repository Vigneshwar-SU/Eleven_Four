And one day I saw her in an brown color top with black jeans and eyeliner in her eyes just made her look like a goddess and that moment I realized where has this gurl been I mean like look at her any boy could fall for her. When we got close day by day I started to realize that she isn't just gorgeous outside but inside too. This fine shyt is not just a Hooman but a kind soul too. When she use to yap about all her insecurities, my eyes only looked at her like the perfect creature of humankind, I am one among those who would never let her down in any circumstances and also I just love the way you are stay the same. Life has been so hard for you lately we all know that but we gotchu, never ever mind what others say you are just as perfect as your🩵I could just keep  saying things about you but here one last thing: You literally deserve the best in life keep working hard and the universe will make it up to you my gurl❤LYSM"</p>
