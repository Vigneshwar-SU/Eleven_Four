# Birthday site (static)

This is a small static single-page site scaffold to celebrate someone's birthday. It contains sections for family, friends, dream, vision, and the "about us" gallery.

How to use
- Open `index.html` in your browser (no build step required).
- Replace the placeholder images in the `images/` folder with your photos. Keep the same filenames or update the `src` attributes in `index.html`.
- Edit the text content (headings, paragraphs, captions) to personalize the messages.

Optional enhancements
- Add confetti (e.g., canvas-confetti from CDN) when the user clicks the "Open your surprise" button.
- Add audio by inserting an `<audio>` element and playing it from `script.js`.
- Replace the simple lightbox with a library like `basicLightbox` or `SimpleLightbox` if you want more features.

Deploy
- GitHub Pages: create a repo, push this folder to the `gh-pages` branch or enable Pages from `main` with `/` root.
- Netlify: drag-and-drop the folder or connect the repository.

Notes
- Keep images reasonably sized for web (800–1200px width). Compress with tools like Squoosh or tinyjpg.
